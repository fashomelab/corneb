## üöÄ About The Project

This homelab evolved from tinkering with Raspberry Pis into a production-grade setup for practicing DevOps. It's 100% automated ‚Äì from VM provisioning to app deployments ‚Äì demonstrating scalable, secure systems.

**Key Goals:**
- Showcase infrastructure, cloud, and automation expertise.
- Host resilient services for learning and experimentation.
- Automate everything via code for repeatability.

## üîç Technical Deep Dive

<details>
  <summary><strong>Virtualization: 3-Node Proxmox HA Cluster</strong></summary>
  <br>
  The foundation of the on-premise lab is a 3-node Proxmox cluster, providing a resilient and flexible platform for all virtualized workloads.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clustering & High Availability:</strong> A 3-node setup was chosen to learn and implement enterprise-grade resilience. If one host fails, critical VMs can be automatically migrated to another node.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Teaming (LAGs):</strong> Link Aggregation is configured to the managed switch, preventing network bottlenecks and providing redundancy for the entire cluster.</li>
    <li><strong>Dedicated Workloads:</strong> A key design choice was to isolate workloads onto specific nodes for stability and performance. For example, <code>proxmox2</code> is dedicated to the virtualized <strong>pfSense router</strong> to protect core network functions, while <code>proxmox3</code> is tailored for storage-heavy services like <strong>TrueNAS Scale</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>(Suggestion: Add a small diagram showing the Proxmox cluster layout.)</em>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Networking: pfSense, VLANs & Site-to-Site VPN</strong></summary>
  <br>
  A virtualized pfSense router acts as the brain of the network, managing security, routing, and traffic segmentation.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security-First Design:</strong> Virtualizing the firewall allows for easy snapshots, backups, and quick recovery. <strong>Snort</strong> is used for active intrusion detection, and the entire network is segmented into five <strong>VLANs</strong> to prevent lateral movement. For example, untrusted IoT devices are on a separate network and cannot access management interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>VPN Gateway:</strong> The firewall functions as a central VPN gateway, providing two key capabilities: secure <strong>remote access</strong> into the homelab (as a VPN server), and a persistent <strong>site-to-site (S2S) tunnel</strong> to Microsoft Azure, securely bridging my on-premise and cloud environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Services:</strong> All essential network services (DHCP, DNS, firewall rules) are centralized on pfSense for simplified management.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>(Suggestion: Add a diagram showing VLAN segmentation.)</em>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Kubernetes: Multi-Cluster GitOps Environment (k3s)</strong></summary>
  <br>
  The heart of my service deployment strategy is a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment. This setup mirrors enterprise best practices by separating management, production, and development workloads for enhanced security and stability. All clusters are managed declaratively using GitOps principles.
  <ol>
    <li><strong><code>cauldron-factory</code> (Management Cluster):</strong> This cluster follows the "management cluster" pattern, providing a central point of control. Managed by <strong>FluxCD</strong>, it hosts <strong>Rancher</strong> for UI-based management, along with core services like Traefik and Cert-Manager.</li>
    <li><strong><code>horizon-mountain</code> (Production Cluster):</strong> This cluster is dedicated to running primary, user-facing applications for the internal network. Managed by <strong>ArgoCD</strong>, it uses <strong>Cilium with BGP</strong> for advanced eBPF networking and includes a production-grade stack with <strong>HashiCorp Vault (HA)</strong> and <strong>Longhorn</strong> for storage. Access is strictly internal, protected from the public internet.</li>
    <li><strong><code>zero-dawn</code> (Dev/Test & CI Cluster):</strong> This cluster acts as a sandbox and hosts CI/CD infrastructure, including <strong>self-hosted GitHub Actions runners</strong>. This isolates resource-intensive build jobs from the production environment, ensuring performance and security.</li>
  </ol>
  <em>(Suggestion: Add screenshots of Rancher or ArgoCD.)</em>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Physical Infrastructure: High-Availability Raspberry Pi Fleet</strong></summary>
  <br>
  To ensure critical services are always online without the power consumption of the main server cluster, a dedicated fleet of low-power Raspberry Pis runs 24/7. This is a deliberate design choice focused on energy efficiency and resilience.
  <ul>
    <li><strong><code>ravager</code> & <code>apollo</code> (HA DNS):</strong> A redundant <strong>Pi-hole</strong> setup in an active/passive cluster using <strong>Keepalived</strong> to manage a virtual IP for seamless failover.</li>
    <li><strong><code>thunderjaw</code> (External Monitoring):</strong> Runs <strong>Uptime Kuma</strong> to monitor all infrastructure from an external viewpoint, ensuring alerts are sent even if the primary network is down.</li>
    <li><strong><code>sawtooth</code> (Isolated I/O Workloads):</strong> This node is dedicated to a high-volume data ingestion workload, keeping this high-churn activity separate from the main storage arrays to protect their performance.</li>
    <li><strong><code>stormbird</code> (Tiered Storage & Central Monitoring):</strong> Runs <strong>OpenMediaVault</strong> as a fast staging area for data, which is then synced nightly to the main TrueNAS VM. It also hosts the central <strong>Prometheus</strong> & <strong>Grafana</strong> "single pane of glass" for the entire lab.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>(Suggestion: Add a photo or diagram of the Pi fleet.)</em>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Automation: IaC & Hybrid Cloud Strategy</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Automation is the central principle of this lab, with a clear separation of concerns between provisioning (Terraform) and configuration (Ansible).
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Terraform (IaC):</strong> Manages the entire lifecycle of all Proxmox VMs, with state stored securely in <strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong> to enable CI/CD integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Ansible (Configuration Management):</strong> Configures new VMs after provisioning, handling security hardening and application setup. Playbooks are triggered automatically by an <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> pipeline.</li>
    <li><strong>Azure Cloud Services:</strong> An <strong>Entra ID App Registration</strong> provides secure, passwordless authentication for all automated services (Terraform, ADO) interacting with the Azure subscription.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>(Suggestion: Add a flowchart showing the Terraform ‚Üí Ansible workflow.)</em>
</details>

* **Containerization & Orchestration:** Deep expertise in **Docker** and **Kubernetes (k3s)**, including advanced networking (**Cilium**), storage (**Longhorn**), and security (**Sealed Secrets**, **Vault**).
* **Hybrid-Cloud Management:** Seamlessly managing resources across on-premise (**Proxmox**, Raspberry Pis) and cloud platforms (**Azure**).
* **Observability:** Building a comprehensive, multi-layered monitoring stack with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Uptime Kuma**.
* **Network Security:** Implementing network segmentation with **VLANs**, enterprise-grade firewalls with **pfSense/Snort**, and robust secrets management.
