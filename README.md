## üöÄ What I Built

### Infrastructure Provisioning ([apexvirtual-terraform](https://github.com/fashomelab/apexvirtual-terraform))
- 29 VMs across hybrid cloud (Proxmox + Azure)
- Multi-environment management (on-prem, Azure dev, Azure prod)
- Data-driven infrastructure from YAML configuration
- Secretless CI/CD with Vault OIDC authentication

### Configuration Management ([apexvirtual-ansible](https://github.com/fashomelab/apexvirtual-ansible))
- Tag-based dynamic inventory from Terraform
- Automated OS hardening and security baseline
- Role-based architecture with 15+ reusable components
- Monitoring federation across infrastructure

### Application Deployment ([apexvirtual-gitops](https://github.com/fashomelab/apexvirtual-gitops))
- GitOps patterns with ArgoCD
- Multi-cluster Kubernetes management
- Sealed secrets for encrypted credentials

## üèÜ Key Technical Achievements
- **90% Faster Provisioning**: Reduced VM provisioning from 90 minutes to under 10 minutes through automated Terraform and Ansible pipeline.  
- **100% Secretless CI/CD**: Eliminated all static credentials using GitHub OIDC and HashiCorp Vault integration.  
- **Multi-Environment Consistency**: Single codebase manages dev, prod, and on-prem environments with zero configuration drift.  
- **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**: Seamless resource management across Proxmox (on-premise) and Azure (cloud) platforms.  

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform follows a three-stage pipeline: infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.

### Infrastructure Layer (Terraform)
- Provisions VMs from YAML-defined specifications
- Applies tags for automated configuration targeting
- Manages network segmentation (VLANs 283, 284, 285)
- Stores state in Azure Blob Storage with locking

### Configuration Layer (Ansible)
- Discovers infrastructure via Proxmox dynamic inventory
- Groups hosts by Terraform-applied tags
- Deploys monitoring, security, and application services
- Retrieves all credentials from Vault at runtime

### Application Layer (GitOps)
- Declarative Kubernetes manifests in Git
- ArgoCD syncs cluster state automatically
- Sealed secrets for credential management
- Multi-cluster deployment patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Proxmox VE, Microsoft Azure  
- **Configuration**: Ansible, HashiCorp Vault, Docker  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (k3s), ArgoCD, FluxCD  
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
